# Pandas and GitHub

## This is the sixth homework assignment for Lede Program 2025.

### It's a pair of Jupyter notebooks that poke two datasets: one simple csv of dogs and cats and another of 2014's Bloomberg list of the world's billionaires.

This assignment was meant to get us familiar with the way pandas does things vs. how Python itself may do them:

- How to ingest data and work with it as a dataframe
- How to parse and query data to answer you may have a data journalist or analyst
- How to generate graphs of things using pandas as well as two graphign libraries: matplotlib and altair

To view these documents, you'll need to use Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.

1. Install Python: Make sure you have Python installed (Python 3.6 or later recommended).

2. Install Jupyter and other required libtaries: Open your command prompt or terminal and run:

`pip install notebook jupyterlab pandas matplotlib altair`


### Option 1: Jupyter Notebook

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook: In your terminal, type:

`jupyter notebook`

2. This will open a browser window showing the Jupyter Notebook dashboard where you can create or open notebooks.

### Option 2: Jupyter Lab (Alternative)

1. Launch Jupyter Lab: In your terminal, type:

`jupyter lab`

2. This opens Jupyter Lab, a more advanced interface that includes notebooks, file browser, terminals, and other tools in a flexible layout.

### Using Either Interface

- Option 1: From the menu, select Cell → Run All
- Option 2: Press the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Alt+Enter (or Cmd+Alt+Enter on Mac)
- Option 3: Click the "Fast Forward" button (▶▶) in the toolbar if available

Then, wait for execution to complete.

Cells are executed in sequence. A number in brackets [1] appears next to each cell when it completes.

After that, scroll through the notebook and behold my struggles.

Happy viewing!
